a = 10; //var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;

//Till 2015 let and const were not used
// If the value of the variable is going to be an universal constant like pi, sin 0 use const
// If the value of the variable is going to change use let. Also where const can't be used
// Use var only if you are working with older code or browser compatibility
